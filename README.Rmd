## Installation

The latest stable version of {svHttp} can simply be installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("svHttp")
```

You can also install the latest development version. Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

``` r
remotes::install_github("SciViews/svSocket")
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install {svHttp}.

Latest devel version of {svHttp} (source + Windows binaries for the latest stable version of R at the time of compilation) is also available from [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/phgrosjean/svHttp/build/artifacts).
