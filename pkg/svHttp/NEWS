Transcript of changes concerning the HTTP server from svGUI

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-51

* HTTP server now works with the new version of captureAll() from svMisc 0.9-62
  and it is compatible with its echo = and split = arguments.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-50

* HTTP server now works correctly with incomplete commands (bug corrected).


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-49

* HTTP server code processing now uses parseText() of svMisc >= 0.9-60 instead
  of the deprecated Parse() function.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-48

* The R http server is modified to work with either RJsonP calls, or with plain
  text exchange, as the SciViews socket server works. RJsonP objects returned
  use list() to create lists, but also structures or new S4 objects.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-47

* A new series of function to communication with a SciViews GUI client like
  Komodo/SciViews-K by using the R http help server is added. It offers a
  tcltk-free alternative to the svSocket server.
  
* The package no longer starts the socket server implemented in svSocket and it
  does not import svSocket any more. As the HTTP server is an alternative, one
  could now choose to run SciViews communication through the HTTP server without
  using svSocket, and thus, without starting Tcl/Tk any more.
