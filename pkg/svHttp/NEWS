== Changes in svHttp 0.9-54

* LICENSE file eliminated.

* No more use of ::: (not allowed by CRAN).


== Changes in svHttp 0.9-54

* NEWS file reworked to use the new Rd format.

* Temporary data are now saved in SciViews:TempEnv environment (was TempEnv),
  and one thus needs svMisc >= 0.9-68.


== Changes in svHttp 0.9-53

* If the Http server is not started, .onUnload() failed in
  tools::startDynamicHelp(FALSE). Fixed.
  

== Changes in svHttp 0.9-52

* Functions to manage the SciViews HTTP server have been moved from svGUI 0.9-51
  to here.
  
* The SciViews HTTP server was broken under R 2.13.0 because of wrong arguments
  in the function called by HTTP clients. Fixed now.
  
* The SciViews HTTP server cannot accept very long instructions (they are
  truncated). In such a case, write the instructions in a file instead and pass
  SOURCE=<filepath> as message. Note that the temporary file is deleted by the
  HTTP server after use. The maximum length of the request is perhaps different
  from one to the other system (I had little problems on Mac OS X). It is
  probably safe to use a file if argument is more than 100 characters long. Note
  that encoding for this temporary file is assumed to be UTF-8!
  

Transcript of changes concerning the HTTP server from svGUI

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-51

* HTTP server now works with the new version of captureAll() from svMisc 0.9-62
  and it is compatible with its echo = and split = arguments.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-50

* HTTP server now works correctly with incomplete commands (bug corrected).


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-49

* HTTP server code processing now uses parseText() of svMisc >= 0.9-60 instead
  of the deprecated Parse() function.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-48

* The R http server is modified to work with either RJsonP calls, or with plain
  text exchange, as the SciViews socket server works. RJsonP objects returned
  use list() to create lists, but also structures or new S4 objects.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-47

* A new series of function to communication with a SciViews GUI client like
  Komodo/SciViews-K by using the R http help server is added. It offers a
  tcltk-free alternative to the svSocket server.
  
* The package no longer starts the socket server implemented in svSocket and it
  does not import svSocket any more. As the HTTP server is an alternative, one
  could now choose to run SciViews communication through the HTTP server without
  using svSocket, and thus, without starting Tcl/Tk any more.
